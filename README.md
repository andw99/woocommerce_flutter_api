# WooCommerce Flutter API

A comprehensive Flutter package for seamless WooCommerce integration. Easily manage authentication, notifications, cart, and product data with updated dependencies and full documentation.

## Dependencies

This package leverages the following dependencies:

- [dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) (^5.4.1) for HTTP requests
- [faker](https://pub.dev/packages/faker) (^2.1.0) for generating fake data during development
- [flutter_secure_storage](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_secure_storage) (^9.0.0) for secure data storage
- [pretty_dio_logger](https://pub.dev/packages/pretty_dio_logger) (^1.3.1) for logging HTTP requests in a readable format

## Installation

To install the package, run:

```bash
flutter pub add woocommerce_flutter_api
```

## Usage

Create the main WooCommerce object to access all the features of the package:

```dart
final woocommerce = WooCommerce(
  baseUrl: '<woocommerce-url>', 
  username: '<username>', 
  password: '<password>', 
  useFaker: true,
  isDebug: true, // true by default
  apiPath: '<some-custom-path>',
);
```
### Using Fake Data (`useFaker`)

The `useFaker` property is designed for development and testing purposes. When set to `true`, all API requests will return fake data generated by the [faker](https://pub.dev/packages/faker) package. This is especially useful if your WooCommerce backend is still under developmentâ€”allowing you to build and test your application without relying on live data. Once your backend is ready, simply set `useFaker` to `false` to receive real data.

Example of initializing with fake data enabled:

```dart
final woocommerce = WooCommerce(
  baseUrl: '<woocommerce-url>', 
  username: '<username>', 
  password: '<password>', 
  useFaker: true,
  isDebug: true, // true by default
  apiPath: '<some-custom-path>',
);
```

In this mode, every API call (e.g., authentication, notifications, cart, products) will return simulated responses, allowing you to continue development seamlessly until your WooCommerce backend is published.

### Authentication

Login and securely store the user ID:

```dart
await woocommerce.login('<email>', '<password>');
```

### Notifications

Fetch all notifications for the currently logged in user:

```dart
final notifications = await woocommerce.getNotifications();
```

### Cart

Retrieve the cart for the current user:

```dart
final cart = await woocommerce.getCart();
```

### WooCommerce API

Fetch a list of products:

```dart
final response = await woocommerce.getProducts();
```
